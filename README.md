# rhythmPatterns
Load this html file into your browser and generate rhythmic patterns of eighth notes, quarter notes, and eighth-note triplets. No server needed.

You must install the included (open source) [MusiSync font](https://www.fontspace.com/musisync-font-f3723 ) in order to see the correct visual rendering of the rhythm. 

Use the Option buttons to generate patterns of increasing complexity:

  1: eighth and quarter notes only
  
  2: everything in option 1, plus rests

  3: everything in option 2, plus eighth note triplets

  4: everything in option 3, plus rests in the triplets
  

Control the density of triplets for Options 3 and 4, by choosing a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. 0 is no triplets, 1 is all triplets.
